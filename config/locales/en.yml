    executive_summary_first: For the past two decades, China’s economic power has increased at an astonishing rate. Government controls have encouraged the majority of financial proceeds to remain within China, until recently. Over the last five years, the largest Chinese firms have begun expanding their operations and influence abroad, as the Chinese government strides to loosen financial controls. 
    executive_summary_second: With the market for Chinese internal investments becoming over-saturated and diminishing returns weighing on clients' minds, international markets struck by the global financial crisis will offer discounted assets. QPC’s aim is to assist small-to-mid-cap Chinese clients identify & evaluate opportunities, navigate international regulations and broker deals. Additionally QPC offers consulting services on an ad hoc basis for larger M&A deals and business development projects.
